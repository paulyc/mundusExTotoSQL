 1 In principio creavit Deus cælum, et terram.
 2 Terra autem erat inanis et vacua, et tenebræ erant super faciem abyssi: et Spiritus Dei ferebatur super aquas.
 3 Dixitque Deus: Fiat SQL. Et facta est SQL.

## Habent Mundum in Manibus
Inverse of NoSQL: If everything is a file, and every file is SQL, then EVERYTHING IS SQL, innit?

### Deep thoughts for cunning (or not) linguists
Shoulda paid attention in Latin class. Oops, I didn't take Latin.
But it seems as though English is a reasonable enough substitute in the verb
conjugation dept, at least. Nouns are a whole other story but actual Romance
languages aren't going to help you there either and they don't even have gerunds.

I think Dutch taught me more about noun conjugation than French and it doesn't have
noun conjugation either but it is more like German which has the most Latin-like case
system of any extant Latin-script-native language that I'm familiar with.
(Well they all conjugate for plurality. You don't think of it)

Unsure why Romance languages dropped noun conjugation, which at least had some
syntactic significance and made gender even more important though it has none
whatsoever that I can tell. Written Latin seems to use it very sparingly;
technically maybe it's all masculine but if that is simply the default,
then it has no syntactic significance, does it? In the script dept,
diacritics occasionally do but usually don't since there is usually only one
valid sentence you can string together from a given set of diacritics or lack thereof.
